abstract: Activity in striatal direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons
  (SPNs) is critical for proper movement. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal
  organization of this activity. We investigated the spatiotemporal organization of
  SPN ensemble activity in mice during self-paced, natural movements using microendoscopic
  imaging. Activity in both pathways showed predominantly local but also some long-range
  correlations. Using a novel approach to cluster and quantify behaviors based on
  continuous accelerometer and video data, we found that SPN ensembles active during
  specific actions were spatially closer and more correlated overall. Furthermore,
  similarity between different actions corresponded to the similarity between SPN
  ensemble patterns, irrespective of movement speed. Consistently, the accuracy of
  decoding behavior from SPN ensemble patterns was directly related to the dissimilarity
  between behavioral clusters. These results identify a predominantly local, but not
  spatially compact, organization of direct- and indirect-pathway SPN activity that
  maps action space independently of movement speed.
