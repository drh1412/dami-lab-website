abstract: Recent anatomical evidence suggests a functionally significant back-projection
  pathway from the subiculum to the CA1. Here we show that the afferent circuitry
  of CA1-projecting subicular neurons is biased by inputs from CA1 inhibitory neurons
  and the visual cortex, but lacks input from the entorhinal cortex. Efferents of
  the CA1-projecting subiculum neurons also target the perirhinal cortex, an area
  strongly implicated in object-place learning. We identify a critical role for CA1-projecting
  subicular neurons in object-location learning and memory, and show that this projection
  modulates place-specific activity of CA1 neurons and their responses to displaced
  objects. Together, these experiments reveal a novel pathway by which cortical inputs,
  particularly those from the visual cortex, reach the hippocampal output region CA1.
  Our findings also implicate this circuitry in the formation of complex spatial representations
  and learning of object-place associations.
