abstract: We present a semi-automated reconstruction of L2/3 mouse primary visual
  cortex from 3 million cubic microns of electron microscopic images, including pyramidal
  and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and precursors,
  pericytes, vasculature, mitochondria, and synapses. Visual responses of a subset
  of pyramidal cells are included. The data are being made publicly available, along
  with tools for programmatic and 3D interactive access. The density of synaptic inputs
  onto inhibitory neurons varies across cell classes and compartments. We uncover
  a compartment-specific correlation between mitochondrial coverage and synapse density.
  Frequencies of connectivity motifs in the graph of pyramidal cells are predicted
  quite accurately from node degrees using the configuration model of random graphs.
  Cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger and more reliable
  visual responses. These example findings illustrate the resource's utility for relating
  structure and function of cortical circuits as well as for neuronal cell biology.
