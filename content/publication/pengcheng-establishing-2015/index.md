abstract: "Pairs of active neurons frequently fire action potentials or \\\"spikes\\\
  \" nearly synchronously (i.e., within 5 ms of each other). This spike synchrony\
  \ may occur by chance, based solely on the neurons' fluctuating firing patterns,\
  \ or it may occur too frequently to be explicable by chance alone. When spike synchrony\
  \ above chances levels is present, it may subserve computation for a specific cognitive\
  \ process, or it could be an irrelevant byproduct of such computation. Either way,\
  \ spike synchrony is a feature of neural data that should be explained. A point\
  \ process regression framework has been developed previously for this purpose, using\
  \ generalized linear models (GLMs). In this framework, the observed number of synchronous\
  \ spikes is compared to the number predicted by chance under varying assumptions\
  \ about the factors that affect each of the individual neuron's firing-rate functions.\
  \ An important possible source of spike synchrony is network-wide oscillations,\
  \ which may provide an essential mechanism of network information flow. To establish\
  \ the statistical link between spike synchrony and network-wide oscillations, we\
  \ have integrated oscillatory field potentials into our point process regression\
  \ framework. We first extended a previously-published model of spike-field association\
  \ and showed that we could recover phase relationships between oscillatory field\
  \ potentials and firing rates. We then used this new framework to demonstrate the\
  \ statistical relationship between oscillatory field potentials and spike synchrony\
  \ in: 1) simulated neurons, 2) in vitro recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal\
  \ cells, and 3) in vivo recordings of neocortical V4 neurons. Our results provide\
  \ a rigorous method for establishing a statistical link between network oscillations\
  \ and neural synchrony."
