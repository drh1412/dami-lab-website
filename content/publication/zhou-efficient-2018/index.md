abstract: In vivo calcium imaging through microendoscopic lenses enables imaging of
  previously inaccessible neuronal populations deep within the brains of freely moving
  animals. However, it is computationally challenging to extract single-neuronal activity
  from microendoscopic data, because of the very large background fluctuations and
  high spatial overlaps intrinsic to this recording modality. Here, we describe a
  new constrained matrix factorization approach to accurately separate the background
  and then demix and denoise the neuronal signals of interest. We compared the proposed
  method against previous independent components analysis and constrained nonnegative
  matrix factorization approaches. On both simulated and experimental data recorded
  from mice, our method substantially improved the quality of extracted cellular signals
  and detected more well-isolated neural signals, especially in noisy data regimes.
  These advances can in turn significantly enhance the statistical power of downstream
  analyses, and ultimately improve scientific conclusions derived from microendoscopic
  data.
