abstract: Experience-driven synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala is thought
  to underlie the formation of associations between sensory stimuli and an ensuing
  threat. However, how the central amygdala participates in such a learning process
  remains unclear. Here we show that PKC-Î´-expressing central amygdala neurons are
  essential for the synaptic plasticity underlying learning in the lateral amygdala,
  as they convey information about the unconditioned stimulus to lateral amygdala
  neurons during fear conditioning.
