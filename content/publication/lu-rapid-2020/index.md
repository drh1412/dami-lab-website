abstract: Imaging neurons and neural circuits over large volumes at high speed and
  subcellular resolution is a difficult task. Incorporating a Bessel focus module
  into a two-photon fluorescence mesoscope, we achieved rapid volumetric imaging of
  neural activity over the mesoscale with synaptic resolution. We applied the technology
  to calcium imaging of entire dendritic spans of neurons as well as neural ensembles
  within multiple cortical regions over two hemispheres of the awake mouse brain.
