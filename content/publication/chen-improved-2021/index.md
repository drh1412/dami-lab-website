abstract: Cellular barcoding methods offer the exciting possibility of 'infinite-pseudocolor'
  anatomical reconstruction --- i.e., assigning each neuron its own random unique
  barcoded 'pseudocolor,' and then using these pseudocolors to trace the microanatomy
  of each neuron. Here we use simulations, based on densely-reconstructed electron
  microscopy microanatomy, with signal structure matched to real barcoding data, to
  quantify the feasibility of this procedure. We develop a new blind demixing approach
  to recover the barcodes that label each neuron. We also develop a neural network
  which uses these barcodes to reconstruct the neuronal morphology from the observed
  fluorescence imaging data, 'connecting the dots' between discontiguous amplicon
  signals.
