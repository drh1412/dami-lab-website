 abstract = {Cellular barcoding methods offer the exciting possibility of 'infinite-pseudocolor' anatomical reconstruction --- i.e., assigning each neuron its own random unique barcoded 'pseudocolor,' and then using these pseudocolors to trace the microanatomy of each neuron. Here we use simulations, based on densely-reconstructed electron microscopy microanatomy, with signal structure matched to real barcoding data, to quantify the feasibility of this procedure. We develop a new blind demixing approach to recover the barcodes that label each neuron. We also develop a neural network which uses these barcodes to reconstruct the neuronal morphology from the observed fluorescence imaging data, 'connecting the dots' between discontiguous amplicon signals.},
