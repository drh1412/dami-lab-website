abstract: The hippocampus is traditionally thought to transmit contextual information
  to limbic structures where it acquires valence. Using freely moving calcium imaging
  and optogenetics, we show that while the dorsal CA1 subregion of the hippocampus
  is enriched in place cells, ventral CA1 (vCA1) is enriched in anxiety cells that
  are activated by anxiogenic environments and required for avoidance behavior. Imaging
  cells defined by their projection target revealed that anxiety cells were enriched
  in the vCA1 population projecting to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) but not
  to the basal amygdala (BA). Consistent with this selectivity, optogenetic activation
  of vCA1 terminals in LHA but not BA increased anxiety and avoidance, while activation
  of terminals in BA but not LHA impaired contextual fear memory. Thus, the hippocampus
  encodes not only neutral but also valence-related contextual information, and the
  vCA1-LHA pathway is a direct route by which the hippocampus can rapidly influence
  innate anxiety behavior.
