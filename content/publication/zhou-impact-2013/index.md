abstract: Synchronization plays an important role in neural signal processing and
  transmission. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of neural
  synchronization. In recent years, correlated noise-induced synchronization has received
  support from many theoretical and experimental studies. However, many of these prior
  studies have assumed that neurons have identical biophysical properties and that
  their inputs are well modeled by white noise. In this context, we use colored noise
  to induce synchronization between oscillators with heterogeneity in both phase-response
  curves and frequencies. In the low noise limit, we derive novel analytical theory
  showing that the time constant of colored noise influences correlated noise-induced
  synchronization and that oscillator heterogeneity can limit synchronization. Surprisingly,
  however, heterogeneous oscillators may synchronize better than homogeneous oscillators
  given low input correlations. We also find resonance of oscillator synchronization
  to colored noise inputs when firing frequencies diverge. Collectively, these results
  prove robust for both relatively high noise regimes and when applied to biophysically
  realistic spiking neuron models, and further match experimental recordings from
  acute brain slices.
