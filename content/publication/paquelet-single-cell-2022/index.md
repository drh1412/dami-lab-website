abstract: The serotonin system modulates a wide variety of emotional behaviors and
  states, including reward processing, anxiety, and social interaction. To reveal
  the underlying patterns of neural activity, we visualized serotonergic neurons in
  the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT) of mice using miniaturized microscopy during
  diverse emotional behaviors. We discovered ensembles of cells with highly correlated
  activity and found that DRN5-HT neurons are preferentially recruited by emotionally
  salient stimuli as opposed to neutral stimuli. Individual DRN5-HT neurons responded
  to diverse combinations of salient stimuli, with some preference for valence and
  sensory modality. Anatomically defined subpopulations projecting to either a reward-related
  structure (the ventral tegmental area) or an anxiety-related structure (the bed
  nucleus of the stria terminalis) contained all response types but were enriched
  in reward- and anxiety-responsive cells, respectively. Our results suggest that
  the DRN serotonin system responds to emotional salience using ensembles with mixed
  selectivity and biases in downstream connectivity.
