abstract: Motivational states consist of cognitive, emotional, and physiological components
  controlled by multiple brain regions. An integral component of this neural circuitry
  is the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Here, we identify that neurons
  within BNST that express the gene prepronociceptin (PnocBNST) modulate rapid changes
  in physiological arousal that occur upon exposure to motivationally salient stimuli.
  Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we find that PnocBNST neuronal responses
  directly correspond with rapid increases in pupillary size when mice are exposed
  to aversive and rewarding odors. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of these neurons
  increases pupillary size and anxiety-like behaviors but does not induce approach,
  avoidance, or locomotion. These findings suggest that excitatory responses in PnocBNST
  neurons encode rapid arousal responses that modulate anxiety states. Further histological,
  electrophysiological, and single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that PnocBNST neurons
  are composed of genetically and anatomically identifiable subpopulations that may
  differentially tune rapid arousal responses to motivational stimuli.
