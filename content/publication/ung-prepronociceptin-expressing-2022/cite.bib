 abstract = {Dysregulation in the neural circuitry that encodes physiological arousal responses is thought to contribute to the manifestation of the maladaptive behaviors observed in neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously found that prepronociceptin-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (PnocBNST neurons) modulate rapid changes in physiological arousal upon presentation of motivationally salient stimuli (Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2020). However, whether PnocBNST neurons are necessary to regulate behavioral actions to motivationally salient stimuli is still unknown. Here, we investigated the role of PnocBNST neurons in encoding behavioral responses to motivationally salient stimuli using in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic approaches in freely behaving mice. We find that the bulk activity of PnocBNST neurons increases when mice are near an aversive odor in comparison to a rewarding odor. However, optogenetic inhibition of PnocBNST neurons does not affect the amount of time mice spend near an aversive odor. Further analysis revealed that a subgroup of PnocBNST neurons that correlate with proximity to the aversive odor also correlate to darting away from the same aversive odor. Since these two behaviors are opposite to each other and since we previously found PnocBNST neurons correlate with arousal responses, we believe these results may be due in part to the encoding of arousal responses that occur when mice approach and dart away from aversive stimuli.},
