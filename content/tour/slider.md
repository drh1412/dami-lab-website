    - title:  Welcome to the group
      content: In one sentence, we summarize our research interests and objectives to provide computational tools for neuroscience research driven by experimental data.

    - title: Develop automated tools Ô∏è
      content: The data collected by modern neuroscience shows explosive growth in both complexity and scale. The traditional data analysis methods will take a huge time or be powerless at all. Therefore, we need to develop fully automated and intelligent algorithms for specific problems to create a complete automation process of data collection, storage, visualization, automatic processing and statistical analysis.

    - title: Interpret data
      content: The work of the brain depends on the complex connection and synergy between a large number of neurons, but the data we record in the brain are all isolated neurons. It is not direct to find the law of interaction between these neurons. Therefore, I will develop some machine learning methods to mine hidden features in data, or statistical models to interpret data.
